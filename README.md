The analysis file contains code to reproduce analyses from the manuscript: 
Bl√∂chl et al., "A limit of the subjective age bias: Feeling younger by a set amount, but no more, is beneficial for life satisfaction" (2020)

Data for this project came from the Enlglish Longitudinal Study of Ageing (Wave 2) and 
can be downloaded here: https://beta.ukdataservice.ac.uk/datacatalogue/series/series?id=200011

Data analyses comprise 3 main scripts. Script 1 defined all models as specified in the 
manuscript. Script 2 comprises data preprocessing and also runs all main analyses. 
Script 3 runs any additional analysis. 
Please note that there are two helper scripts ("frm.R", and "rsa_plot.R"), which have to be sourced in the main script.
